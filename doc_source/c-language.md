# AWS Encryption SDK for C<a name="c-language"></a>

The AWS Encryption SDK for C provides a client\-side encryption library for developers who are writing applications in C\. It also serves as a foundation for implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK in higher\-level programming languages\.

Like all implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK, the AWS Encryption SDK for C offers advanced data protection features\. These include [envelope encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/crypto/latest/userguide/cryptography-concepts.html#define-envelope-encryption), additional authenticated data \(AAD\), and secure, authenticated, symmetric key [algorithm suites](concepts.md#crypto-algorithm), such as 256\-bit AES\-GCM with key derivation and signing\.

All language\-specific implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK are fully interoperable\. For example, you can encrypt data with the AWS Encryption SDK for C and decrypt it with [any supported language implementation](programming-languages.md), including the [AWS Encryption CLI](crypto-cli.md)\.

The AWS Encryption SDK for C uses the AWS SDK for C\+\+ to interact with AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) so it can support the optional [AWS KMS keyring](use-kms-keyring.md)\. However, the AWS Encryption SDK doesn't require AWS KMS or any other AWS service\.
