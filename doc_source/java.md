This topic explains how to install and use the AWS Encryption SDK for Java\. For details about programming with the AWS Encryption SDK for Java, see the [aws\-encryption\-sdk\-java](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-java/) repository on GitHub\. For API documentation, see the [Javadoc](https://aws.github.io/aws-encryption-sdk-java/javadoc/) for the AWS Encryption SDK for Java\.

## Prerequisites<a name="java-prerequisites"></a>

Before you install the AWS Encryption SDK for Java, be sure you have the following prerequisites\.

**A Java development environment**  
You will need Java 8 or later\. On the Oracle website, go to [Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), and then download and install the Java SE Development Kit \(JDK\)\.  
If you use the Oracle JDK, you must also download and install the [Java Cryptography Extension \(JCE\) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html)\.

**Bouncy Castle**  
The AWS Encryption SDK for Java requires [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html)\.   
+ AWS Encryption SDK for Java versions 1\.6\.1 and later use Bouncy Castle to serialize and deserialize cryptographic objects\. You can use Bouncy Castle or [Bouncy Castle FIPS](https://www.bouncycastle.org/fips_faq.html) to satisfy this requirement\. For help installing and configuring Bouncy Castle FIPS, see [BC FIPS Documentation](https://www.bouncycastle.org/documentation.html), especially the **User Guides** and **Security Policy** PDFs\.
+ Earlier versions of the AWS Encryption SDK for Java use Bouncy Castle's cryptography API for Java\. This requirement is satisfied only by non\-FIPS Bouncy Castle\.
If you don't have Bouncy Castle, go to [Bouncy Castle latest releases](https://bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html) to download the provider file that corresponds to your JDK\. You can also use [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to get the artifact for the standard Bouncy Castle provider \([bcprov\-ext\-jdk15on](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.bouncycastle/bcprov-ext-jdk15on)\) or the artifact for Bouncy Castle FIPS \([bc\-fips](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.bouncycastle/bc-fips)\)\.

**AWS SDK for Java \(Optional\)**  
The AWS Encryption SDK for Java doesn't require the AWS SDK for Java\. However, [AWS SDK for Java version 1\.11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/welcome.html) is required to use [AWS Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) \(AWS KMS\) as a master key provider\. It's also required for some of the [example Java code](java-example-code.md) in this guide\.  
To install the AWS SDK for Java, use Apache Maven\. To [import the entire AWS SDK for Java](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-project-maven.html#configuring-maven-entire-sdk) as a dependency, declare it in your `pom.xml` file\. To create a dependency only for the AWS KMS module, follow the instructions for [specifying particular modules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-project-maven.html#configuring-maven-individual-components), and set the `artifactId` to `aws-java-sdk-kms`\.

## Installation<a name="java-installation"></a>

You can install the AWS Encryption SDK for Java in the following ways\.

**Manually**  
To install the AWS Encryption SDK for Java, clone or download the [aws\-encryption\-sdk\-java](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-java/) GitHub repository\.

**Using Apache Maven**  
The AWS Encryption SDK for Java is available through [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) with the following dependency definition\.  

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
  <artifactId>aws-encryption-sdk-java</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

After you install the SDK, get started by looking at the [example Java code](java-example-code.md) in this guide and the [Javadoc on GitHub](https://aws.github.io/aws-encryption-sdk-java/javadoc/)\.
