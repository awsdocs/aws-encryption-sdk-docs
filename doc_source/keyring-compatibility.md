# Keyring compatibility<a name="keyring-compatibility"></a>

Although the different language implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK have some architectural differences, they are fully compatible, subject to language constraints\. You can encrypt your data using one language implementation and decrypt it with any other language implementation\. However, you must use the same or corresponding wrapping keys to encrypt and decrypt your data keys\. For information about language constraints, see the topic about each language implementation, such as [Compatibility of the AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript](javascript-compatibility.md) in the AWS Encryption SDK for JavaScript topic\.

The following table shows which master keys and master key providers are compatible with the keyrings that the AWS Encryption SDK supplies\. Any minor incompatibility due to language constraints is explained in the topic about the language implementation\.


**Compatible Keyrings and Master Key Providers**  

| Keyring: | Master Key Provider: | 
| --- | --- | 
| [AWS KMS keyring](use-kms-keyring.md) |  [KMSMasterKey \(Java\)](https://aws.github.io/aws-encryption-sdk-java/com/amazonaws/encryptionsdk/kms/KmsMasterKey.html) [KMSMasterKeyProvider \(Java\)](https://aws.github.io/aws-encryption-sdk-java/com/amazonaws/encryptionsdk/kms/KmsMasterKeyProvider.html) [KMSMasterKey \(Python\)](https://aws-encryption-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/aws_encryption_sdk.key_providers.kms.html) [KMSMasterKeyProvider \(Python\)](https://aws-encryption-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/aws_encryption_sdk.key_providers.kms.html#aws_encryption_sdk.key_providers.kms.KMSMasterKeyProvider)  The AWS Encryption SDK for Python and AWS Encryption SDK for Java don't include a master key or master key provider that is equivalent to the [AWS KMS regional discovery keyring](use-kms-keyring.md#kms-keyring-regional)\.    |
