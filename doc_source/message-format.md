# AWS Encryption SDK message format reference<a name="message-format"></a>


|  | 
| --- |
|  The information on this page is a reference for building your own encryption library that is compatible with the AWS Encryption SDK\. If you are not building your own compatible encryption library, you likely do not need this information\. To use the AWS Encryption SDK in one of the supported programming languages, see [Programming languages](programming-languages.md)\. For the specification that defines the elements of a proper AWS Encryption SDK implementation, see the *AWS Encryption SDK Specification* in the [aws\-encryption\-sdk\-specification](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-encryption-sdk-specification/) repository in GitHub\.  | 

The encryption operations in the AWS Encryption SDK return a single data structure or [encrypted message](concepts.md#message) that contains the encrypted data \(ciphertext\) and all encrypted data keys\. To understand this data structure, or to build libraries that read and write it, you need to understand the message format\.

The message format consists of at least two parts: a *header* and a *body*\. In some cases, the message format consists of a third part, a *footer*\. The message format defines an ordered sequence of bytes in network byte order, also called big\-endian format\. The message format begins with the header, followed by the body, followed by the footer \(when there is one\)\.

The [algorithms suites](algorithms-reference.md) supported by the AWS Encryption SDK use one of two message format versions\. Algorithm suites without [key commitment](concepts.md#key-commitment) use message format version 1\. Algorithm suites with key commitment use message format version 2\.

## Header structure<a name="header-structure"></a>

The message header contains the encrypted data key and information about how the message body is formed\. The following table describes the fields that form the header in message format versions 1 and 2\. The bytes are appended in the order shown\. 

The **Not present** value indicates that the field doesn't exist in that version of the message format\. **Bold text** indicates values that are different in each version\.

**Note**  
You might need to scroll horizontally or vertically to see all of the data in this table\.

**Type**  <a name="header-type"></a>
The type of this message format\. The type indicates the kind of structure\. The only supported type is described as *customer authenticated encrypted data*\. Its type value is 128, encoded as byte `80` in hexadecimal notation\.  
This field is not present in message format version 2\.

**Algorithm ID**  <a name="header-algorithm-id"></a>

**Message ID**  <a name="header-message-id"></a>
A randomly generated value that identifies the message\. The Message ID:  
+ Uniquely identifies the encrypted message\.
+ Weakly binds the message header to the message body\.
+ Provides a mechanism to securely reuse a data key with multiple encrypted messages\.
+ Protects against accidental reuse of a data key or the wearing out of keys in the AWS Encryption SDK\.
This value is 128 bits in message format version 1 and 256 bits in version 2\.

**AAD Length**  <a name="header-aad-length"></a>
The length of the additional authenticated data \(AAD\)\. It is a 2\-byte value interpreted as a 16\-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of bytes that contain the AAD\.  
When the [encryption context](concepts.md#encryption-context) is empty, the value of the AAD Length field is 0\.

**AAD**  <a name="header-aad"></a>
The additional authenticated data\. The AAD is an encoding of the [encryption context](concepts.md#encryption-context), an array of key\-value pairs where each key and value is a string of UTF\-8 encoded characters\. The encryption context is converted to a sequence of bytes and used for the AAD value\. When the encryption context is empty, there is no AAD field in the header\.  
When the [algorithms with signing](algorithms-reference.md) are used, the encryption context must contain the key\-value pair `{'aws-crypto-public-key', Qtxt}`\. Qtxt represents the elliptic curve point Q compressed according to [SEC 1 version 2\.0](http://www.secg.org/sec1-v2.pdf) and then base64\-encoded\. The encryption context can contain additional values, but the maximum length of the constructed AAD is 2^16 \- 1 bytes\.

## Body structure<a name="body-structure"></a>

The message body contains the encrypted data, called the *ciphertext*\. The structure of the body depends on the content type \(nonframed or framed\)\. The following sections describe the format of the message body for each content type\. The message body structure is the same in message format versions 1 and 2\.

**Topics**
+ [Non\-framed data](#body-no-framing)
+ [Framed data](#body-framing)

### Non\-framed data<a name="body-no-framing"></a>

Non\-framed data is encrypted in a single blob with a unique IV and [body AAD](body-aad-reference.md)\.

**Note**  
Whenever possible, use framed data\. The AWS Encryption SDK supports nonframed data only for legacy use\. Some language implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK can still generate nonframed ciphertext\. All supported language implementations can decrypt framed and nonframed ciphertext\.

The following table describes the fields that form nonframed data\. The bytes are appended in the order shown\.


**Non\-Framed Body Structure**  

| Field | Length, in bytes | 
| --- | --- | 
| [IV](#body-unframed-iv) | Variable\. Equal to the value specified in the [IV Length](#header-iv-length) byte of the header\. | 
| [Encrypted Content Length](#body-unframed-content-length) | 8 | 
| [Encrypted Content](#body-unframed-content) | Variable\. Equal to the value specified in the previous 8 bytes \(Encrypted Content Length\)\. | 
| [Authentication Tag](#body-unframed-tag) | Variable\. Determined by the [algorithm implementation](algorithms-reference.md) used\. | 

**IV**  <a name="body-unframed-iv"></a>
The initialization vector \(IV\) to use with the [encryption algorithm](algorithms-reference.md)\.

**Encrypted Content Length**  <a name="body-unframed-content-length"></a>
The length of the encrypted content, or *ciphertext*\. It is an 8\-byte value interpreted as a 64\-bit unsigned integer that specifies the number of bytes that contain the encrypted content\.  
Technically, the maximum allowed value is 2^63 \- 1, or 8 exbibytes \(8 EiB\)\. However, in practice the maximum value is 2^36 \- 32, or 64 gibibytes \(64 GiB\), due to restrictions imposed by the [implemented algorithms](algorithms-reference.md)\.  
The Java implementation of this SDK further restricts this value to 2^31 \- 1, or 2 gibibytes \(2 GiB\), due to restrictions in the language\.

**Encrypted Content**  <a name="body-unframed-content"></a>
The encrypted content \(ciphertext\) as returned by the [encryption algorithm](algorithms-reference.md)\.

**Authentication Tag**  <a name="body-unframed-tag"></a>
The authentication value for the body\. It is used to authenticate the message body\.

### Framed data<a name="body-framing"></a>

In framed data, the plaintext data is divided into equal\-length parts called *frames*\. The AWS Encryption SDK encrypts each frame separately with a unique IV and [body AAD](body-aad-reference.md)\.

**Note**  
Whenever possible, use framed data\. The AWS Encryption SDK supports nonframed data only for legacy use\. Some language implementations of the AWS Encryption SDK can still generate nonframed ciphertext\. All supported language implementations can decrypt framed and nonframed ciphertext\.

 

The [frame length](#header-frame-length), which is the length of the [encrypted content](#body-framed-regular-content) in the frame, can be different for each message\. The maximum number of bytes in a frame is 2^32 \- 1\. The maximum number of frames in a message is 2^32 \- 1\.

There are two types of frames: *regular* and *final*\. Every message must consist of or include a final frame\. 

All regular frames in a message have the same frame length\. The final frame can have a different frame length\. 

The composition of frames in framed data varies with the length of the encrypted content\.
+ **Equal to the frame length** — When the encrypted content length is the same as the frame length of the regular frames, the message can consist of a regular frame that contains the data, followed by a final frame of zero \(0\) length\. Or, the message can consist only of a final frame that contains the data\. In this case, the final frame has the same frame length as the regular frames\.
+ **Multiple of the frame length** — When the encrypted content length is an exact multiple of the frame length of the regular frames, the message can end in a regular frame that contains the data, followed by a final frame of zero \(0\) length\. Or, the message can end in a final frame that contains the data\. In this case, the final frame has the same frame length as the regular frames\.
+ **Not a multiple of the frame length** — When the encrypted content length is not an exact multiple of the frame length of the regular frames, the final frame contains the remaining data\. The frame length of the final frame is less than the frame length of the regular frames\. 
+ **Less than the frame length** — When the encrypted content length is less than the frame length of the regular frames, the message consists of a final frame that contains all of the data\. The frame length of the final frame is less than the frame length of the regular frames\.

The following tables describe the fields that form the frames\. The bytes are appended in the order shown\.
